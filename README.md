# pagemin
Pagemin ("page-eee-min" or "page-eh-min" similar to pokemon) is the minimal core of the Page framework

Page framework: http://github.com/h3rb/page
You'll need a schema, or you can create your own.

Pagemin comes without an auth, though you can view core/Auth.php for where you would add such logic.

It also doesn't have all of the sample application cruft from the Page repo.   A nice to place to start, unless you are building an API, in which case you may wish to take a look at http://github.com/h3rb/papi
